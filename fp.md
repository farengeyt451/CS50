Hi
My name is Alexander and I am developer from Ukraine, Kharkiv.
My final project is `ngx-tippy-wrapper`. This is Angular open-source wrapper library for Tippy.js - vanilla JS plugin. The aim of this project to create convenient and declarative way for tooltip/popover managing.
This project helped me understood how to create library, rollup and publish it to the npm repository, how to write unit tests and create CI/CD cycle. Also I practiced in documentation writing and issues managing. So I got a lot of experience not only in development but in creating and managing open source repository.
